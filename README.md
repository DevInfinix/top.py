An alternative wrapper for the [top.gg API](//docs.top.gg)

*Please note, this is __not an official package from top.gg__. We are not affiliated with top.gg in any way.
If you want to install their official package, please see [their repo](//github.com/top-gg/python-sdk).*


## Installation
You can install the latest stable release here:
```shell
pip install top.py
```
But, if you're reading this, you're most likely a developer - you should know how to install packages by now.

## Getting support
Please feel free to mention me (`@eek#7574`/`<@421698654189912064>`) in the top.gg server, 
or join the dragdev studios server [here](//discord.gg/YBNWw7nMGH)

## Usage
We now have docs at [toppy.dragdev.xyz!](//toppy.dragdev.xyz) These docs are built weekly from the master branch.

## Examples
*Moved to [examples.md](/examples.md)*
